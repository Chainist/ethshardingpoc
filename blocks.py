'''
as a general thought, our goal is to make "the world" seem valid from the point of view of every block

"valid" in our case means:

logs hold messages with bases and sources from the expected shards
logs grow monotonically
sources and bases are monotonic
sources and bases agree
receives happen from sources

And also these more difficult ones:

local receives happen before the TTL (is the received message's base not more than TTL prevblocks away)
sents are received before the TTL (as seen from bases)

We need to look at our receives and see them be received by the TTL

And look at the bases and sources and:

see our sent messages be received by the TTL

see their sent messages be received by the TTL
